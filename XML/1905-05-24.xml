                    <p>The sculptor Paul Dubois is dead
                    (Havas.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Paul Dubois, who was one of the greatest of modern sculptures, was born at Nogent-sur-Seine, July 18, 1829. He was destined by his father for the legal profession, but his artistic tastes constrained him to devote himself to sculpture, and he went to Paris to become the pupil of the sculptor Toussaint, with whom he remained three years. In 1859 he went to Italy, and in 1860 executed at Florence the model for "St. John a Child," which was finished at Rome, exhibited at the Salon of 1863, and is now at the Luxembourg, together with “A Florentine Singer of the Fiftienth Century." This last is in silvered bronze and thought its many reproductions in smaller size has become very popular. Other works which may be cited are the tomb of General'la Moriciere, one of the masterpieces of modern statuary (1878), which is at Nantes; and busts of Bonnat, Cabanel, Paul Baudry, Gounod, Pasteur (1890), and other celebrities. M. Dubois also studied painting, and had executed nine portraits and beautiful copies of old masters but was a very  irregular contributor to the Salon exhibitions. In 1873 he was appointed keeper of the Luxembourg Museum, and director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, May 30, 1878. Elected a member of the Academie des Beaux-Arts in 1876, he was one of the Jury of Admission for the selection of sculpture at the Exposition of 1878. He was a grand officer of the Legion of Honour (1889).

                    <p>London, May 23.</p>
                    <p>The scene in the House of Commons is without parallel in the history of the House. The speakers, chiefly Mr Lyttelton, were greeted with angry cries of "Bring in the Guards!” “Where are the police!” and by the blowing of police whistles. After Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Brodrick has sat down, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman again appealed to Mr. Balfour declaring that by his silence he alone was responsible for the disturbance. This renewed the uproar and Mr. Balfour rose and severely rebuked the House for its unseemly behaviour. Never in his experience had it refused to listen to a Minister speaking for the Government, nor had the Opposition presumed to dictate the order of speeches. To-night's precedent, if followed, would absolutely ruin the Commons. Mr.Lyttelton again rose, but the storm burst with redoubled fury. The Deputy Speaker adjourned the House by virtue of the new rule reffering to a grave disorder. The prolongation of the scene is attributed to the fact that the Deputy-Speaker, who presided in consequence of the Speaker's illness, has no power to suspend individual Members.(Reuter.)

                   <p> House of Commons.- The House to-day was thronged, and Sir H. Campbell Bannerman and Mr. Balfour were received with extraordinary ovations on entering. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman asked whether in view of the confusion created by the recent declarations of Ministers with reference to the fiscal question and the Colonial Conference, Mr. Balfour would fix a day for a vote of censure. Mr. Balfour said that two Ministers were prepared to clear up any confusion yesterday, when they wore prevented by the disgraceful proceedings which Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman did nothing to prevent. He had no objection to fixing a day provided he had an undertaking that the debate would be conducted with ordinary de ceney and fair play. The matter was then dropped.

The rapid and practical method of the Berlitz School can in a very short time give a sufficient knowledge of the language of the country in which one may be traveling.

                    <head>NO EGGS DISCOVERED.</head>
                    
                    <p>Assiout Moudirieh is now pronounced entirely free from locusts. A careful watch is being exercised in this and in the other provinces of Upper Egypt, but no eggs have been discovered anywhere except in one district of Minieh. The inhabitants have responded with great alacrity to the orders of the local authorities.

                    <div type="item"><head>THE COTTON WORM.</head>
                    
                    <p>The seriousness of the present situation can be grasped when we state that the actual loss due to the worm during the cotton season last year is estimated at between 1,000,000l. and 2,000,000l. at least.
                    </p>
                    <p>The life-history of the worm is as follows :amp; About the beginning of June the moth lays eggs (about 300) on a leaf near the bottom of the plant. These are easily soon on examination. The period of incubation is from three to four days. The young worms begin to feed on the leaf on which they are hatched. They grow very rapidly, and in a few days spread over the entire plant. After feeding (from 18 to 22 days), the worms burrow into the soil, construct cells, and pass the pupa stage (8 to 10 days). The moths then hatch out and commence laying again. The whole life-history is thus from 30 to 40 days, depending to a certain extent on climatic conditions. In July, therefore, we bare a second brood, followed by a thud in August, after which the worms find food elsewhere. It is clear that the pest can be most satisfactorily attacked by picking the leaves on which the eggs are found. When the worms have spread over the plant, they eat the young buds, flowers, leaves, &c., and it is impossible to do much. Fields have to be examined every few days when eggs are being laid. It is evident that the more thoroughly the June brood is kept in check, the less severe will subsequent generations be.

During the past season 20 nurses were enrolled on the register, which is kept by the matron of the Anglo-American Hospital, Cairo, to whom applications for private nurses should be made. In conclusion, the committee wish to thank Mr. Rowlatt for his kindness in again auditing the accounts of the fund.

                    <p>This morning, at about 10.30 ’o'clock, a serious outrage took place in Mohamed Aly square, Alexandria, which resulted in grave injuries to Ahmed Khalil, late consular janissary to the American consular agency and at present bowab to St. Mark's Small Building. While the man was on an errand and was walking through the square to collect some money , an unknown person rushed up to him and folded him to the ground with a sharp instrument,. evidently some iron weapon. His upper lip was cut clean open and a gaping wound extends under the nose. The aggressor at once made off, leaving his victim lying in a pool of blood. The injured man has been taken to the Government Hospital. He is quite unable to identify his would-be assassin, who fortunately did not plunge the weapon far enough into the man's mouth to inflict fatal injuries to the throat. It is strange that such a bloodthirsty outrage could have been committed in Mohamed Aly square, which was crowded with people, at that hour, and the assassin have escaped scot free.

                    <p>It appears that Yambio, the Nyam-Nyam chief, whose death we announced in our Saturday’s issue, had been the mainstay of the whole revolt, and that from the first his people wanted to come in, but were kept back by him. He ruled his people with extreme severity, his only punishment was death, and this was meted out frequently for the slightest offence. Large numbers of women and girls were found closely confined and jealously guarded in his village. All were released and sent book to their villages whenever possible. Among the trophies captured was the Sultan's great war drum. It stands four feet high, is cut out of a single tree trunk, and is carved to represent a buffalo. At Yambio's funeral there was no great display of grief, and on this being pointed out by a British officer, an Arab-speaking native answered “No ; they are not sorry, for if Yambio had died a natural death and had been buried by his own people, least 300 of them would have been slain at the same time. "After establishing posts throughout the whole district, and explaining the object of the Government, the remainder of the force returned to Waw at the end of March. The expedition was an unqualified success, and reflects great credit on Major Boulnois and all the officers under his command. On the way back one of the officers had rather a narrow escape. A leopard he had wounded badly came straight for him, and though hit again in the neck, was not finished off before it had bitten him deep in the arm and crunched the right hand with its powerful jaws.

The natives remembered Emin well. Of Gordon only a few natives seemed to know anything, though most of those living near the river had heard of “Godun," as he was called, and an interesting relic had been secured in the shape of an Austrian bentwood chair, which Gordon had given to the chief Gimorro. The chair was to be seen in a room adjoining the lecture theatre.

Important also is the striking at the lowest level of a vein 22in. wide, and assaying 33dwt to the ton. There is satisfactory news also from the Atallah Mine of the Central Egypt Exploration Company, and a few more favorable developments will serve to neutralize the North Nile Valley affair. There is room for-much expansion in the Egyptian market, provided the mining industry shows that it is good for something, and the strong hand of the Government is there to prevent gross abuses.

I refer to the "writing on the wall" here and there stating that "there is room here for a stand of 4 cabs and in others for 6, and so on." I have never yet found any cabs taking up their positions on these legalized stands but crawlers are still crawling and others place their carriages and horses half across the end of a street so as to be seen down the whole of it, to the great inconvenience of those turning into these streets when the abuggies are begged to "kasskiss” and get out of the way. In the early morning no cabs are to be found down the whole length of Rosetta-road, which is a long one, and this is a great inconvenience to people who do not keep their own carriages. The same thing occurs late in the evening. If the “writing on the wall" has any in it why are there instructions treated as null and void.
