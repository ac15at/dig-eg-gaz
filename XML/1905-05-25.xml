<p>Motor Fire Engines.— We notice with interest the extraordinary development of the
motor fire engine that is taking place all over the world as the following list of orders Messrs. Merryweather & Sons, Limited, have recently secured shows.

<div type="item"><head>NEW EGYPTIAN COMPANY.</head>

<head>IMPORTANT FLOTATION.</head>

<head>"EGYPT, LIMITED.”</head>

<p>Among the forthcoming Egyptian flotations there is one very important company, the prospectus of which will soon be set before the public. The company will be known by the comprehensive and attractive title of "Egypt, Limited." One of the advantages of this name is that the company will not be confused in the minds of the investors with the mass of other new companies whose founders have not shown any originality in their nomenclature. Egypt, Limited, is to have a capital of £250,000 with power to increase to a million. The London board of directors is composed of a number of business men, well-known in the world of commerce and finance. These include Mr. Callender, of telegraph and construction fame, whose products are well known hero, Mr. J. A. H. Drought, chairman of the United Lankat Plantations Company, which is one of the favorite industrial securities is the London market, Mr. John Waddington, the founder of Egyptian Options, and Mr. Doolette, chairman of the Oroya Brownhill Co., Limited, one of the premier Australian mining securities on the London market. One or two other well-known names will, it is understood, also appear on the prospectus. The entire capital has been guaranteed both in London and Egypt unlike the majority of companies having advisory boards here, the Egyptian directors,whose names we will announce shortly, will be represented by a delegation on the London board, and in this way will be able to exercise a salutary check on the London board in their Egyptian investments. The chief object of the company will be mortgage business, the
purchase and resale of land, the development of building estates, and the promotion and guaranteeing of new Egyptian enterprises. With regard to the last object Egypt, Limited, intends to promote another Egyptian mortgage company, which has already been guaranteed to the extent of over a million pounds sterling. It is needless to point out that the promotion profits of the parent company will b considerable.

<head>ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</head>

<head>REPORT FOR 1904-1905.</head>

<p>Dr. Breccis, in his very interesting report, announces some very satisfactory results of the progress of the above society. The appereance of the Bulletins Nos. 6 and 7 have gained the esteem of other learned societies to such an extent that seventeen scientific associations have offered to make exchanges with that of the A. A. S., In this way its library will grow rapidly ; it already contains many important works. Several learned men connected with European Universities and Museums have promised to write articles for the Bulletin of the A. A. S. which will greatly help Dr. Breccia in bringing out a regular quarterly review. In answer to a request made by the last general meeting Dr. Breccia inaugurated a series of lectures at the Popular University on archeological subjects, two of which have been given already, one on
“The Recent Discoveries in Crete and Mycaenian Civilisation," and the other on “Greek and Arab Civilization in Sicily,” both illustrated with limelight views. They were so well attended that Dr. Breccia feels encouraged to continue the series in the Museum itself, where his audience can see the objects of interest to which he will refer. The excavations carried out at the expense of the A. S. S. Fund westt of the Victoria College were of great interest, but were unavoidably interrupted. The things, however, discovered there will be treated of in the next Bulletin in an article by Simond Bey and Dr. Breccia. The excavations at Hadra, in the Eastern Necropolis, also proved to be important as a rich series of loculi of the Ptolemaic period were discovered, the doors of which were painted in the style of that period in different colours and in some instances with the addition of inscriptions. Notwithstanding the friability of the stone several of those doors have been safely removed to the Museum. The attention of savants has been attracted lately to the connection between the Alexandria tomb paintings and those known as Pompeian and this similarity is strikingly noticeable in these tomb-doors lately found at Gabbari. Funeral urns and fragments of statuettes known, as Tanagrae were also found in the same place.
Excavations under the auspices of the Museum Committee have been also undertaken at Chatby in what has proved to be a Necropolis of tho 1st Ptoleinaic period, the results of which will be found in a separate notice in the next Bulletin, Members of the society meanwhile are invited to visit the Museum and see these latest discoveries. Excursions-having been proposed by the committee and approved of by the general meeting, the first come off on 17th April last, when the members went in great numbers to Aboukir to visit the mosaics discovered by H. H. Prince Omar Toussoun on his property and who has kindly offered them to the society. This excoursion was most successful and much appreciated by all who took part in it, and it is proposed to continue them from time to time. Dr. Schiess Bey, president of the Museum Committee, has invited members to promenade lectures in the Museum— where the conservator will hold peripatetic discourses. An excursion to Chalby will be organized later on with the approval of the general assembly, also to Taposiris Magna, Mariout, etc. H. H. Prince Omar Toussoun, having always taken a keen interest in the work of the A.A.S., was invited by the committee to become their honorary president, which he has graciously agreed to do, and presided at the last committee meeting. The dedicatory tablet to the memory of the late conservator, Dr. Botti, is not yet ready, but it is hoped that it will shortly be finished, so that the ceremony which has been for some time planned can then take place, i.e., of removing the remains of the learned professor and placing them in an ancient sarcophagus as a suitable monument. It was proposed by Simond Bey and Dr. Schiess Bey that Professor
Maspero should be begged by the A. A. S. to allow them to have two of the obelisks lying about amongst the rains of San presented to the city of Alexandria, and the Municipality promises to pay the cost of transport. Many
now members have joined lately, especially since the excursion to Aboukir, and donations have been received from Artin Pasha, Judge Batcheller, and others.

<div type="item"><head>CLEVER HASHISH SEIZURE.</head>

<head>1,070 KILOS OF THE DRUG FOUND.</head>

<p>A clever seizure of smuggled hashish was effected by a Coastguard patrol on Monday
at a point on the coast about 10 kilometers west of Rosetta lighthouse.</p>
<p>The hashish, which weighed no less than 1070 kilos and was packed in 16 sacks, had been landed on the previous evening by a blockade runner, and removed to its place of hiding, it evidently being the intention of the smuggler to take tho drug away into the interior the following night.
</p>
<p>Their intentions, however, were frustrated by the Coastguard patrol, consisting of one onbashi (corporal) and a tracker. Early on Monday morning the patrol found traces of the landing which had been made near a road much used by fishermen leading from the sea to Bossili. The patrol followed tire tracks and eventually,after some hours’ search, came to some sand dunes, wherein the hashish had been buried.
</p>
<p>Judging by the tracks on the sand, four camels were used to transport the hashish from the seashore, and the escort consisted of twenty men, one of whom was on horseback.
</p>
<p>The hashish seised is valued at something like £2,400. It will, in accordance with custom, be entirely destroyed. The lucky onbashi and his tracker come into a sum of over £100 as prize money for their seizure.

<div type="item"><head>A. L. M. &amp; D. S.</head>

<p>As we briefly stated in our issue of yesterday, Tuesday’s concert of the Alexandria
Literary, Musical &amp; Dramatic Society was a great success. The programme was a long
and interesting one, and there was not a dull moment from beginning to end. It opened with an “andante maestoso" on the piano for four hands, excellentiy played by Misses
Giorgina and Gemma Fiteni, two little mites, who, with their equally small sister, Alice, delighted the audience with two more selections and an encore. We found them best in Suppe’s “onverture moderato" (paragraph 3), where they showed clever mechanism and a perfect understanding of the use of the pedal. Considering that the piano was anything but easy to play on, their performance was highly commendable. Miss Euna Lang Anderson,whose talent is not unknown to A.L.M & D.S. audiences, contributed two violin solos, and for her exquisite execution of Mariani’s “L’Abandono" secured a well deserved encore when she gave a spirited rendering of “Perpetuo Mobile." Miss MunGavin was in splendid voice and sang M. E. Dandridge’s
“One Flower” with great feeling and effect, her rendering of "My Heart is Weary"
from Nadeschda, in the second part, being likewise given in her usual finished style.
Mrs. F. Cree, who contributed two items, Godard’s "Jo ne veux pas d’autres choses” and Brahm's “Chansons Tziganes" (No 1), was also in good voice and fully maintained the reputation she has already gained as one of our host singers. Miss Helene Lulos, a young and promising pianist, showed to great advantage in Beethoven's “Adagio grazioso” and Liazt's well-known“Rhapsodie Hengroise.” Albeit having to deal with a most unsympathetic keyboard she played the latter number with all due softness and fully interpreted the spirit of the great composer. Mr. L.A. Johnson gave two selections from the Indian Lore Lyrics, (a) “The Temple Bells” and (b) "When
I wake," as well as“The Lute Player”(Allitsen), all of which he rendered with great taste and feeling. Mr. P. Byrne was also very successful in his two numbers, ‘The Slave Song” (Teresa del Riego) and “Queen of the Roses," from “Haddon Hall,” in the latter of which he appeared to greatest advantage. The accompanists to the singers were Mrs. MunGavin, Mme Foscolo, Miss Gibson, and M. Felix.

<p>A most important business transaction has
just taken place in Cairo whereby one of the largest retail drapery establishments in the Capital has changed hands. The vendors are Messrs. S. and S. Sednaoui, the very large Jewish firm of drapers in the Mousky, whose principals are Selim Bey Sednaoui and Mr. Samaan Sednaoui, and the puechasers are a new English limited liability company, which is being promoted for the purpose. The good will alone has been disposed, of for £70,000! Selim Bey Sednaoui will remain as director of
the business.

<div type="item"><head>CAIRO'S WATER SUPPLY.</head>

<p>In regard to the complaints of a correspondent concerning the water supply of Cairo, which appeared in our issue of Tuesday, we find on making enquiries that the Water Company have for the last 15 days, pumped each day 2.000m.c. more water than daring tire corresponding days of last year. They have pumped with all their engines during 24 hours of each day. The enormous increase in consumption and the abnormal wave of heat can alone account for it but that the town has had the water the company say there is no doubt. On Sunday, part of the filtered supply was out off, as they were
connecting to their new works, but this was only for a few hours, after which the service was resumed.
</p>
<p>The company havo spent nearly £100,000 on their new installation during the last 18
months. This will come into work early next month, to assist the old installation, which will gradually be done away with.
</p>
<p>As regards ice, the company state that the price is never more than P.T. 3.5 the block, whatever the demand. Probably people who buy from Arabs in the street have to pay what the latter choose to ask.

<div type="item"><head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET.</head>

<p>(From Our Financial Correspondent).</p>

<p>London, May 19.
</p>
<p>Things financial, like the Russian fleets,are “fighting shy”. Rumours, like phantom torpedo boats, give pause every few hours and the very mention of political complications of any kind is enough to make the few buyers turn tall. Until doubt is dispelled all will be nervous tension and paralysis. Of this state of things all are tired, and ask “how long can we bear this strain?
</p>
<p>Markets are still idle and awaiting events. The break at the end of last account cleared out, to a very large extent, any weak bull element which existed, and consequently the present position should be more healthy. The tendency is already firmer, and any good news would cause a sharp recovery in prices.
</p>
<p>As to the Egyptian market, prices there keep quietly steady, but without feature. Salt and 8oda are eerier at 33s. and Delta Preterenoe have gone back a shade to 13. Bank shares are firm. The latest new issue, the North Egypt Land Company,is quoted at 1/8 premium, and should the proposed irrigation scheme be sanctioned and the company’s application for the extension of the Nubarieh Canal be acceded to by the Egyptian Government, there ought to be a good future for the shares, of which 100,000 £1 shares out of 230,000 are now offered at par.
</p>
<p>The mining section is still weak from sheer want of interest. Prices continue to sag away, and ought certainly to be worth attention for looking up. Egyptians are inclined to be firmer, Nile Valley Block “E" attracting attention on the developments reported from the Dongola
Concession, a reef having been struck assaying, in the east shaft, 12 dwts. over 2ft. 3ins, and in the west shaft 1oz. over 1ft. Egyptian mines are also being bought at their present low level. Um Rus at just over £1 and Nile Valleys at 1/1/6/1/8 look really cheap.
